# Milestone: v1.4 - Visibility & Growth

## Completed: 2026-01-20

## Deliverables
- ✅ Comprehensive GEO/SEO Audit (Report generated)
- ✅ `llms.txt` & `robots.txt` Strategy (Implemented)
- ✅ PWA Metadata (Installed)
- ✅ Typesafe Schema Generator (`schema-dts`)
- ✅ Event Privacy Policy (ADR-001)

## Phases Completed
1. Phase 1: The Audit (Privacy & Tech) — 2026-01-20
2. Phase 2: Technical Foundation — 2026-01-20
3. Phase 3: Semantic Enrichment — 2026-01-20

## Metrics
- **Objective:** Maximum Marketing Visibility, Zero User Data Leakage.
- **Outcome:** 
    - Landing Page is indexable.
    - Events (`/e/*`) are architecturally `noindex`.
    - AI Agents have a dedicated map (`llms.txt`).

## Lessons Learned
- **Privacy via Architecture:** Relying on `robots.txt` alone is insufficient. We implemented "Defense in Depth" with `meta noindex` headers on the application layer.
- **Schema Safety:** Manual JSON-LD construction is fragile. `schema-dts` is essential for maintainability.
