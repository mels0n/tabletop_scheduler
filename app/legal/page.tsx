If a server glitch deletes your event and your group misses out on a game of Root or a Magic draft, we apologize for the inconvenience, but we are not legally or financially liable.

                            Tabletop Time is a free, open-source personal project built by Christopher Melson. While we operate on a &quot;Zero Tracking&quot; philosophy, here are the technical realities of how data is processed:

                            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                                We only store the data you explicitly provide to make the app work: proposed event times, display names, and availability votes.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                                If you generously choose to support the project financially via Ko-fi, you control what is shared. If you make a &quot;public&quot; donation, we store your provided name, transaction ID, amount, and message, and proudly display your name and message on our homepage ticker to thank you. If you mark your donation as &quot;private&quot; on Ko-fi, our system simply drops the webhook data and we do not store your record in our database at all. Unlike event data, public donation records are retained long-term and are not subject to the automated server purge.
                            </p>

                                Like almost all websites, our hosting infrastructure temporarily logs standard request data (such as IP addresses and browser types) solely for security, performance monitoring, and DDOS prevention.

                                If you choose to link Discord or Telegram, here is exactly what we store: your user ID and username on the participant and event records you link, plus the server ID, channel ID, and pinned message ID for any event a host connects to a channel. We never store your access tokens, and we never read your friend lists, message history, or other profile data.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                                Our bots send direct messages for these purposes and nothing else: magic login links you request, waitlist promotion and removal notices, finalize results for events you joined, and quorum alerts to the organizer. If you linked Telegram or Discord, you can turn off these direct messages from your My Events page; login links you request are still sent. Automated posts in a connected group or channel are the live dashboard, a short announcement with the event title and link when a host connects a Discord channel, a notice in a Telegram group asking for the Pin Messages permission if the bot cannot pin the dashboard, a short &quot;updated their availability&quot; post each time someone votes (naming that voter), slot changes, dashboard edits for location changes, finalize announcements, cancel and delete announcements, and the voting or session reminders the organizer enabled. We do not send promotional messages, and we never contact you outside of these functions.
                            </p>

                                This linked identity data is deleted together with the event by the automated cleanup (see Data Rights below for the schedule), and you can delete it yourself at any time.

                                If you linked Discord or Telegram, you can delete that data yourself: open the <Link href="/profile/privacy" className="text-emerald-400 hover:text-emerald-300 underline">Privacy &amp; Data page</Link> while logged in with that platform and use &quot;Unlink&quot; under Linked Accounts. This immediately removes your platform identity from every participant record, every event you manage, and any pending login links.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                                For anonymous event data (names and votes entered without any linked account), ask your Event Host to delete the event, or wait for the automated cleanup. Events are deleted one day after they end (a one-shot one day after its chosen slot, a campaign one day after its last session), drafts one day after their last proposed time, and cancelled events one day after cancellation. Self-hosters can change these with the CLEANUP_RETENTION_DAYS_* variables. No third-party analytics run on the hosted site. For anything else, including deletion requests we should handle manually, open an issue on our GitHub Repository and we will respond there.
