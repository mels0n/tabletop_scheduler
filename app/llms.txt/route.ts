## Key Concepts

**Quorum Logic**: Tabletop Time uses quorum-based scheduling. An organizer sets a minimum player count (the quorum). A candidate date is highlighted as viable only when the number of Yes and If-Needed votes meets or exceeds this threshold. This is distinct from simple overlap discovery: a date with 6 "Yes" votes but below quorum is surfaced differently than one with 4 "Yes" votes above quorum.

**Three-State Voting**: Players vote Yes (available and want to play), If-Needed (available but not preferred), or No (unavailable). If-Needed votes count toward quorum only when no all-Yes date exists.

**Accountless Design**: No user accounts exist. Organizers receive a manager token stored in browser local storage. Participants need no credentials. Events are private by default, accessible only via the unique slug URL.

**Campaign Mode**: Groups multi-session events so organizers can find a run of viable dates (e.g., three consecutive Saturdays) rather than scheduling one session at a time.

## Usage Note

Events are private by default and do not appear in public indexes. The tool is open source and can be self-hosted. Hosted instance: https://tabletoptime.us
