# Why We Don't Want Your Email: The Case for Privacy-First Scheduling

In the modern web, "Free" usually means "You are the product." If you want to use a simple tool to schedule a meeting, you usually have to pay a "Data Tax":
1.  Sign up with Google/Facebook (linking your identity).
2.  Grant permission to read your contacts.
3.  Receive spam emails forever.

For the privacy-conscious tabletop gamer, this is unacceptable. You shouldn't have to dox yourself just to find out if your Paladin is free on Tuesday.

## The "No Login" Philosophy

Tabletop Time was built with a radical premise: **We don't want to know who you are.**

We believe that for a temporary event like a D&D session, a persistent user profile is overkill. You don't need a password, 2FA, or a user dashboard. You just need a shared space to vote on times.

### How It Works (Without the Tracking)

1.  **The Organizer** creates an event. They get a unique, cryptographically random administration link.
2.  **The Players** get a public voting link.
3.  **The Identity**: When you vote, you type a name. That's it.

### For the Hyper-Privacy Aware

If you are deeply concerned about digital hygiene, our system is perfect for you:
-   **Use a Pseudonym**: Use your character name (e.g., "Grog the Barbarian") instead of your real name.
-   **No Email Verification**: We never ask for it.
-   **No Social Graph**: We don't ask to scan your contacts.
-   **Ephemeral Data**: We don't build a shadow profile of your scheduling habits.

## Data Minimization & Retention

We practice **Data Minimization**. We only store exactly what is needed to make the math work:
-   The potential dates.
-   The names provided (which have no verification tied to them).
-   The availability booleans (True/False).

Furthermore, on our hosted instance, we have a strict **Data Purging Policy**. Old events aren't kept in a cold storage vault to be sold to advertisers later. They are deleted.

## Why This Matters for Tabletop

Roleplaying games are often private, intimate spaces. Some groups play in professional environments, others are groups of activists, and some just value their anonymity.

We built this tool because we were tired of trading our privacy for convenience. With Tabletop Time, you get the convenience of a modern scheduler with the privacy of a piece of paper passed around the table.

So go ahead. Use a fake name. Use a VPN. We don't care. We just want to help you roll dice.
