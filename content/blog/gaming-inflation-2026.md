# The Cost of Gaming in 2026: Why You Need a Free Scheduler

## The Sticker Shock of 2026

If you've walked into a friendly local game store (FLGS) lately, you've felt it. The days of the standard $50 "big box" game are largely behind us. Between tariffs on manufacturing, increased shipping logistics, and general inflation, the hobby of tabletop gaming has become a significant financial investment.

## The Breakdown: What Are We Paying?

Research into the current market reveals a new normal for pricing:

*   **Standard Retail Titles**: The "average" strategy game now sits comfortably in the **$60 - $80** range. Even smaller card games often push $25.
*   **Kickstarter & Deluxe Editions**: This is where the wallet really hurts. A "standard" pledge for a hype-driven campaign often starts at **$100**, with "All-In" gameplay bundles frequently exceeding **$250**.
*   **Legacy & Campaign Games**: Massive box experiences (like the latest iterations of *Gloomhaven* or similar dungeon crawlers) are investment pieces, often costing upwards of **$180**.

## The Real Cost: The "Shelf of Shame" Tax

However, the most expensive game isn't the one with the highest price tag—it's the one you bought and **never played**.

We call it the "Shelf of Shame." You backed that massive campaign two years ago. It arrived with 400 miniatures and a rulebook the size of a novel. You paid $200 for it. And now? It collects dust because coordinating 4 adults to sit down for 3 hours is harder than fighting the actual boss monster.

If you buy a $100 game and play it once, that's **$100 per session**.
If you play it 10 times, that's **$10 per session**—cheaper than a movie ticket.

## Maximizing Value with Free Tools

This is where **Tabletop Scheduler** comes in.

To justify the rising cost of our hobby, we need to ensure these games actually hit the table. We need efficiency. We need to stop playing "calendar tetris" in group chats and start playing the games we paid for.

Tabletop Scheduler is, and always will be, **free**. 

Why? Because we believe that you should be spending your money on the games themselves, not on the monthly subscription fees just to find a time to play them.

### How It Helps You Afford the Next Big Release

1.  **Guaranteed Playtime**: By efficiently finding quorum times, you ensure your existing library gets played, increasing the value you get from every dollar spent.
2.  **Zero Overhead**: We don't charge a subscription. That's $5-$10 a month you can put into your "Next Kickstarter" jar.
3.  **Less Burnout**: The frustration of scheduling is a major reason groups fall apart. Removing that friction keeps the group alive, meaning you don't end up with a collection of solo-only experiences (unless that's your thing!).

## Conclusion

Gaming in 2026 is expensive, but it's worth it for the stories we tell and the time we spend together. Don't let logistics be the reason your investment sits on a shelf.

**[Start Scheduling for Free Now](/)** and turn that "Shelf of Shame" into a "Wall of Fame."
