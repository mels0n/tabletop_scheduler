# West Marches & Draft Nights: Managing Rotating Casts of Players

Most RPG advice assumes a "Fixed Party"—the same 4-6 people playing every week. But some of the best gaming experiences come from **Variable Parties**.

Whether you are running a **West Marches** style D&D campaign or hosting a weekly **Magic: The Gathering Draft**, you face a unique challenge: You have a pool of 10+ interested players, but only 4-8 seats per night.

## What is a West Marches Campaign?

West Marches is a style of play where:
1. There is no set play time.
2. There is no set party.
3. **The Players** verify the schedule and tell the DM when they want to explore.

This solves the "Flaky Player" problem. If Player A is busy, Players B, C, D, and E can still go adventuring. But it creates a scheduling nightmare.

## The Logistics of Variable Groups

You need a system that answers two questions:
1. **availability**: Who is free on Friday night?
2. **Commitment**: Who has actually claimed a seat?

### Step 1: Broad Availability Polling

First, you need to know potential dates. Use **Tabletop Time** to create a blanket event for the week (e.g., "Gaming Week of June 1st"). Send it to your entire Discord server or player pool.

You will visually see "Heatmaps" of activity. "Oh, wow, 8 people are free on Friday, but only 3 on Saturday."

### Step 2: Confirmation & Capping

Once you identify the "Hot Night" (e.g., Friday), you lock it in.
- **MTG Drafts**: You need multiples of 8 (ideally). If 10 people are free, the first 8 to commit get the seats.
- **RPG Session**: You might cap the table at 5.

### Step 3: Waitlists

For variable groups, Waitlists are essential. Last-minute drops happen. If you have a list of standby players who you *know* are free (because they filled out the scheduler!), you can ping them instantly. "Hey, Bob dropped, you wanted to play Friday, you in?"

## Managing Draft Pods

For MTG, if you have 12 people show up, do not run a 12-person draft pod. It's a mess.
- **Use the Scheduler data**: See who arrives when.
- **Split the pods**: Run one pod of 8 and one pod of 4 (or two of 6).

## Conclusion

Variable play groups are the most resilient way to keep a hobby community alive. They survive attrition and busy schedules better than fixed groups. But they require strong tools to manage the chaos. Use a dedicated scheduler to herd the cats so you can focus on the game.
