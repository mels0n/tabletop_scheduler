# The Art of the Session Zero: Planning Your Campaign Success

Every great campaign starts before the first die is rolled. It starts with **Session Zero**.

Session Zero is a dedicated meeting where the Dungeon Master (DM) and players agree on the tone, rules, and logistics of the game. It is the foundation of a healthy table. Skipping it is the number one cause of "DM Burnout" and "RPG Horror Stories."

## What to Cover in Session Zero

### 1. Tone and Genre
Is this a grimdark fantasy like *Dark Souls*, or a lighthearted romp like *Guardians of the Galaxy*?
- **Expectations**: If one player builds a goofy bard and another builds a tragic rogue, there will be friction unless the tone is established early.
- **Reference Points**: Use movies or books as touchstones. "We are aiming for *Lord of the Rings*, not *Monty Python*."

### 2. House Rules & Homebrew
Clarify your mechanical deviations.
- Do potions take a bonus action?
- How do you handle critical hits?
- Are any races or classes banned?

### 3. Safety Tools
Tabletop RPGs can explore intense themes. Discuss boundaries.
- **Lines & Veils**: What topics are off-limits (Lines) and what can exist but happens "off-screen" (Veils)?
- **X-Card**: Implement a safety signal to pause the game if things get too uncomfortable.

### 4. The Logistics (Crucial!)
This is often overlooked but is the most practical part of Session Zero.
- **Scheduling**: How often do we play? Weekly? Bi-weekly?
- **Duration**: How long is a session? 3 hours? 5 hours?
- **Location**: Whose house? Or are we online (VTT)?
- **Food/Snacks**: Who brings the chips?

**Pro Tip:** Use this time to set up your **Tabletop Time** group. Create the event, have everyone bookmark the link, and do a test run of scheduling the first real session. Getting everyone used to the tool *now* saves headache later.

## Drafting the Party

Session Zero is the perfect time to build characters *together*.
- **Connections**: How do the characters know each other? "We served in the same army" or "We are siblings."
- **Party Balance**: Ensure you don't end up with 4 Rogues and no Cleric (unless that's the plan!).
- **Group Patron**: Give the group a shared employer or goal to unite them instantly.

## The "Social Contract"

Agree on table etiquette.
- **Phone Policy**: Are phones allowed at the table?
- **Attendance**: What is the policy for missing a game? (See our guide on the Quorum Rule).
- **PvP**: Is Player-vs-Player combat allowed? (Usually, the answer should be "No, unless agreed upon").

## Managing Expectations for New Players

If you have new players, Session Zero is where you teach them the basics.
- Explain the core dice mechanic (d20 + mod).
- help them visualize their character.
- assure them that "roleplaying" doesn't mean doing silly voices (unless they want to).

## Conclusion

A successful campaign isn't built on nat 20s; it's built on clear communication. A solid Session Zero prevents 90% of table disputes. Take the time to plan, align your schedules, and build a world everyone wants to play in.
